### Hi there 👋🤙

I am a techie/windsurfer currently studying Computer Science at UCL and looking out for [wind 💨](https://www.windguru.cz/1013640). I am an Open Technology Engineer at Avanade, working on Open Source - currently co-chairing [Carbon Aware SDK project](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/carbon-aware-sdk) at Green Software Foundation.

Also a game development enjoyer (just for fun!), took part in Warsaw Film School GameJam VI, WFS Game Jam Pro and won HackYeah Game Development Jam !
